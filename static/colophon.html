<body>
	<p>At Boston's JFK/UMass station, two branches of the Red line converge. An inbound train might appear on either platform. Soon before a train arrives, a light and bell announces the platform, and the waiting passengers scurry to obey.</p>
	<p>This app restores an illusion of agency by letting you know, long before the bell sounds, where the train will appear.</p>
	<p>I pray the that the ritual of bell and train was not crafted long ago to appease some long-forgotten evil, for I, like Prometheus, have presumed to share with mere mortals the very Knowledge which the gods so jealously guard.</p>
